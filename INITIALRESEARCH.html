            <h3 class="display-6 text center fs-4"> Student review of teachers is one of the best ways to define the skill of a teacher but as students are often not listened to. Even if they teach it in a well supported traditional way it does not make them a good teacher. They need to be able to learn from the students and adapt. There are still teachers here that have been reported for unreasonable behavior. </h3>
