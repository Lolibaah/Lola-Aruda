            <h3 class="display-6 text center fs-4"> Student review of teachers is one of the best ways to define the skill of a teacher but as students are often not listened to. Even if they teach it in a well supported traditional way it does not make them a good teacher. They need to be able to learn from the students and adapt. There are still teachers here that have been reported for unreasonable behavior. </h3>

          <li>An often cited Academic Aricle on the subject of Student Teacher Review by Hewber W Marsh finds that that student ratings data are: a) multidimensional; b) reliable and stable; c) primarily a function of the instructor who teaches the course; d) relatively valid against a variety of indicators of effective teaching; e) relatively unaffected by a variety of variables hypothesized as potential biases; and f) seen to be useful by faculty, students, and administrators.</li>
